The __________ is the encryption algorithm run in reverse.
decryption algorithm
The purpose of a __________ is to produce a “fingerprint” of a file, message, or other block of data.
hash function
Cyrptanalytic attacks try every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained.
False

True
Triple DES takes a pliaintext block of 64 bits and a key of 56 bits to produce a ciphertext block of 64 bits.
False
Like MAC, a hash function also takes a secret key as input.
False
A __________ is directed at the user file at the host where passwords, token passcodes, or biometric templates are stored. \
host attack

static biometrics
A good technique for choosing a password is to use the first letter of each word of a phrase.
True
Keylogging is a form of host attack.
False
Identifiers should be assigned carefully because authenticated identities are the basis for other security services.
True
Depending on the application, user authentication on a biometric system involves either verification or identification.
True
User authentication is a procedure that allows communicating parties to verify that the contents of a received message have not been altered and that the source is authentic.
False
A __________ is a password guessing program.
password cracker
The __________ strategy is when users are told the importance of using hard to guess passwords and provided with guidelines for selecting strong passwords.
user education
In a biometric scheme some physical characteristic of the individual is mapped into a digital representation.
True
Many users choose a password that is too short or too easy to guess.
True
An individual’s signature is not unique enough to use in biometric applications.
False
Memory cards store and process data.
False
Enrollment creates an association between a user and the user's biometric characteristics.
True
A token is the best means of authentication because it cannot be forged or stolen by an adversary.
False
